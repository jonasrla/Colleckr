Some info about me
==================
I'm a exchange brazilian student. Back in Brazil I was doing my forth year on Computer Engineering on Instituto Militar de Engenharia, but it doesn't mean I'm graduating, engineering degree takes 5 years in Brazil.
I have some experience on C, C++, Java, Python, SQL, Java, Git, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Android.
This project was a little rushed because I actually had to learn to use Flask. I've heard that was good for writting quickly simple apps, so put myself through learning, because the only Web Framework I knew was JavaServlet, which I don't like.
