Some info about me
==================
I'm a exchange brazilian student. Back in Brazil I was doing my forth year on Computer Engineering on Instituto Militar de Engenharia.
I have some experience on C, C++, Python, SQL, Java, Git. And this project was a little rushed because I actually had to learn
to use Flask. I've heard that was good for writting simple apps, and put myself through learning, because the only Web Framework
I knew was JavaServelet, which I find verbose and unsexy.
